## Hi, I'm Pranav

Pranav Agrawal is not a penguin. He is a software Engineer at Facebook, and a graduate student on leave from the Computer Science department at the University of Washington. ~~One day, he shall return — a prodigal son — and finish his PhD.~~ Although he is interested in everything that exists in the universe, he currently focuses on mobile systems, and is driven by a strong desire to learn everything there is to learn about Android, to help make mobile apps suck less. He enjoys solving puzzles, playing racquet sports, and gyring and gimbling in the wabe with the slithy toves and mimsy borogoves.
